# DIY Dyno Notes
Some DIY dyno notes, not to be taken seriously. Just food for thought

# Retarder Selection

>HUB dyno: First mechanical test (after building two centering cylinders to avoid misaligment)
Front brakes: Klam CFK-140 (1700 N*m), up to 800 HP
Rear brakes: Klam CFK-300 (2600 N*m) up to 1100 HP (on construction)
Electronics: SP6 HUB-4 Controller

>According to Klam each CFK-140 can handle 396 HP at 2000 RPM, and it has 2 of them. Probably this will be possible for max 10-15 seconds, but that is what the manufacturer specified. For the next model we used CFK-300 (2600 Nm), and the declared value is (2x) 670 HP at 2000 RPM, so about 1300 HP. Also keep in mind that most cars will end the test about 1500 RPM, this depends on the gearbox type and the tire size (a car with a big tire will have a lower rpm transmission)

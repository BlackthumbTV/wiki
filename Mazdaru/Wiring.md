# Wiring
I used a number of different docs to wire my setup, some of which aren't even for my ECU but still show how some sensors/actuators work.

- [Wiring List](./pdfs/WiringList.pdf)
  - This is what my initial tune had for wiring.
- [Elite Rotary Wiring Guide](./pdfs/how-to-wire-a-rotary-engine-haltech.pdf)
  - This is Haltechs wiring guide for rotaries to Elite ECUs.
- [Platinum Sport Rotary Wiring Guide](./pdfs/Platnium%20Sport%20quick_start_terminated_harness_13b_H2_rev_2.pdf)
  - Haltechs guide to wire rotaries to Platinum Sport ECUs (their old lineup).
- [1998 Impreza ECU Pinout](./pdfs/MazdaruEcuPinout.pdf)
  - The Impreza ECU pinout, which I used to grab things for the ECU (12v power, turn on fuel pump, fans, etc.)

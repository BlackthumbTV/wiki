# Tuning Notes
I tune most all my cars on the road. In general, I find the closest Haltech base tune, and modify it so the car is at a minimum safe, and ideally performant. Measuring performance without a dyno tends to be pretty tough so I'm usually stuck with just tuning fuel, and making sure things aren't knocking with the timing. If I want more power outta it, I don't have that capacity, even with tools like Virtual Dyno.

## How much power am I missing out on by road tuning?
I've tuned my LS swapped RX8 on the dyno. I started by dialing in the AFRs which were basically dead on from the previous road tuning. Then, we started doing full power pulls while modifying the timing. When all was said and done, I did pick up 30hp which was cool, but was it worth the cost of renting the dyno? The horsepower alone, no. But the knowledge I gained during the session was invaluabe, as I was the one who was running the car on the dyno and making the tune changes.

Here's some interesting videos that can also shine some light on the matter:

  - This one in particular is cool, as it nearly reflects my experience with the LS RX8.

  - This one is cool too, shining light on AFRs

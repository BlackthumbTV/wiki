# LS Swapped RX8
My LS swapped 2004 Mazda RX8. A pretty ordinary RX8 swap.

## Introduction
I had hankering to play with an LS, so I decided to look into swapping one into something. I started looking for the cheapest cars I could find that were RWD and that I thought looked cool. Enter the RX8. This was a much easier swap than my [Honda K Swapped RX8](/Hondaru/Index.md).

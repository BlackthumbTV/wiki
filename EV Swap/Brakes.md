# Brakes
No more engine, no more vacuum for brake booster.

You've got two basic options:

1. Use a 12v vacuum pump
2. Use an electric booster

## 12v Vacuum Pump
If you just look up "Electric Brake Booster Vacuum Pump" on eBay you'll find what you want. These things are pretty common outside of EV swaps for cars that have low vacuum, like a car with a very aggressive cam profile. Also for cars that have that auto-shutoff-start-redlight thing.

Here's some part numbers you can use for lookup: ```20804130 20939309 31317530 009428081 20914523 178-0884 20997418 009428-08 26110FJ00```



## Electric brake booster
Electric brake boosters are becoming more common on ICE cars, but they're still quite expensive when compared to a vacuum pump. They do operate independently of the vehicle, probably for failsafe reasons, so you can just give them 12v and ground. But they still probably want a CAN network present. Take that how you will. [This YouTube Video by SuperfastMatt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRZ8XDNz2vU) sumarizes things pretty well.
Most of these things are made by Bosch so you can just look up `iBooster` and you'll proably find what you want.

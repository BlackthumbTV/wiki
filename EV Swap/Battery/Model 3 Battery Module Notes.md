## Battery Info
2170 cells, arranged in a 23s46p config for the shorter modules, and 25s46p for the longer ones.
Each individual cell is 3.7v 4800mAh (maybe?).

### Difference between long range and standard range modules
It looks like the standard range modules simply substitue some cells with more of that glue goop. More info [here](https://youtu.be/8Wamu0hyngU?t=287).

## Teardown
I think my drive unit has the dreaded "milling noise" issue. One that many large rear drive units get with time. Below are my notes on how to fix.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6n0bkLowViFNtoD2bjzkL_IHk5RLS-mvYRUpe2qzGA/edit) shows disassembly and replacement of parts to solve the noise.

[This entire site](https://sites.google.com/view/teslaldu) is quite useful, but [this page](https://sites.google.com/view/teslaldu/parts) in particular has a ton of useful info for replacement parts (because we all know Tesla won't sell 'em to us...)

[This page](http://www.turbo-electric.info/teslaresearch.html) shows some stuff about the motor encoder, including a part number/links to ali express!

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSDrDztx78) provides great instruction for reassembly.

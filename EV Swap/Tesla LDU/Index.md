# Tesla Large Rear Drive Unit (LDU)
While picking up the LDU, the previous owner mentioned that it may be necessary to swap the A and B pins on the encoder in order for the DU to begin rotating.

## Connectors
Main 23 pin connector is an `TE Ampseal 770680-1`. Just so happens to be the came connector as the MS3 Pro Center plug, so you can get a [flying-lead harness](https://www.diyautotune.com/product/ms3pro-ultimate-center-harness/) from them.

The motor encoder connector is a `TE 444046-1`. 

## CV Shafts
Rear CV shafts for the LDU are the same as the SDU, according to an eBay seller.

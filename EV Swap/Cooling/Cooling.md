# Cooling
Tesla uses G48 coolant.

## Pumps
In the past I have used Prius pumps for things, but the video below shows Tesla Model S pumps that can be controlled with simple PWM. You can also read both fault codes and RPM from them over PWM, which is perfect. Found a [supposed manual](./TeslaPumpManual.pdf) for them [here](https://www.diyelectriccar.com/threads/pinout-for-tesla-coolant-pump.200831/) and also [here](https://www.diyelectriccar.com/threads/tesla-water-pump-wiring.204969/).

More good info in [this video](https://youtu.be/Gi5azNOBkdQ?&t=454).

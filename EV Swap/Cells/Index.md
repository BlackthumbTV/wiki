Blow are some pros/cons of each cell chemistry, through my lens of what I plan to achieve with my various EV builds.

## Terms
 - Energy Density: How much total energy a cell stores, IE how much range we'll get.
 - Power Density: How much current the cell can deliver at once, IE how hard we can punch it.
 - Thermal stability: How well the cell performs at low temps, and what it's max upper temps are like.
 - Safety: How safe the cell is, especially in the event something goes wrong.


# Cell Comparisons

## Traditional Lithium (NCA, NMC, etc)
I'm grouping all these together as they sort of fall into the same category for my uses. This is probably the most common chemistry, used in phones, laptops, electric scooters. [Tesla has been using NCA](https://insideevs.com/news/575956/tesla-battery-chemistries-explained/) for a while in their cars, and [will be using NMC](https://insideevs.com/news/598656/tesla-4680-battery-cell-specs/) for their upcoming 4680 cells. These chemistries are the most energy dense out there, and can deliver reasonable power output too. They also require very strigent battery and thermal management. Improper managment can lead to the classic lithium battery failure we've all seen before.

Pros:
 - Incredibly energy dense (250-300 Wh/Kg)
 - Decent power density
Cons:
 -

# Flanges
I created two flanges, one for the K series exhaust manifold and one for the HE300VG flange, which is a T4i. Not a T3 or T4. I didn't end up using these as I was able to get them cheaper on eBay, surprisingly. But I did 3D print them and hold them up to the gaskets/faces and they looked like they'd work.

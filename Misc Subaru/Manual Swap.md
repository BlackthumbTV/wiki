# Manual Swap Parts List
Below is a quick list of things you need to complete an auto-to-manual trans swap on a Subaru. This is a work in progress, but should get you started.

- Manual Transmission
- Manual Transmission Mount/Crossmember
- Matching Rear Differential 
  - IE if your trans has a 3.9 FD, you need a 3.9 FD rear diff.
- Matching Driveshaft
  - The automatic transmission itself is *longer* than the 5 speed, thus its drive shaft is *shorter* than an MT drive shaft. 
  - If you're swapping to a 5 speed, you need the *longer* 5MT drive shaft for the *shorter* five speed.
  - 6 speeds are actually longer than the 5 speed, so the above doesn't apply. 
    - You can use the 4EAT drive shaft with a 6MT.
- Axles (Maybe)
  - If you have a "male" transmission (IE your transmission has stubs), then you need "female" axles.
  - Some transmissions are "female", IE they don't have axle stubs and instead the axle is "male" and pops directly into the trans.
  - So, if you have a "female" trans and "female" axles, you have one of two options
    1. You can just buy "male" axles.
        - You'll need left/right axle seals (below).
    2. You can get "axle stubs" to convert your "female" trans to "male".
        - Axle Stub Shafts (x2): `38415AA110`
        - Axle Circlips (x2): `805329010`
        - Seals
            - Left: `806730041`
            - Right: `806730042`
        - These parts may be able to be sourced from your 4EAT, though I haven't tried this.
- Clutch assembly
  - Flywheel, pressure plate, pilot bearing
  - You'll need the longer MT flywheel bolts as well. The AT flex plate bolts are too short.
- Clutch/Brake Pedal box assembly
- Master/Slave Cylinder
  - or clutch cable assembly, though you'd probably want to go hydro clutch if possible.
- Manual Starter motor
- Shifter assembly
  - This includes the rear bushing/mount
  - The 6MT shifter assembly is different, as has the reverse ring that you pull up on to put the car in reverse.

# Trans Info
Exactly 1 week after posting the [supercharger video](https://youtu.be/Y6_W0FZ5e4A) I grenaded the 5 speed I had in it. It was 2000 2.5 RS 5 speed for those who are interested. I slammed into 2nd a bit too hard demoted it to a 2nd neutral. Ended up driving the car home 40 miles without it, which was fun. 

The choice came down to getting a 6 speed, or popping in a spare 5 speed I had from my old rusted out 2005 2.5 RS daily. I went with the 5 speed as 6 speed costs are much too high, and the power this car makes isn't anything crazy. 

I'm hoping it won't blow again if I get a different clutch setup, reasons why below.

## Ceramic Clutch Issues
I was running a Clutchmasters FX400 Ceramic 8 Puck clutch which suffered from extreme chatter/shudder. When slipping the clutch, either to take off or between gears, the drivetrain would shake violently if there was too much slip, such as on a hill start, hard launch, or when executing imperfect shifts.

Thus, when you're ripping it and shifting, you basically gotta drop the clutch between gears or risk extreme shudder. And when dropping it, you better hope you dropped it at the perfect rev or you shock the drivetrain. Which I didn't and thus the 2nd gear delete.

If there's one thing transmissions hate more than drivetrain shock, it's repeated drivetrain shock from the clutch shuddering.

## Misc Part Numbers
The 2005 2.5 RS trans (and also most six speeds) uses male axles, and thus doesn't have the axle stubs we're used to on the older transmissions. However, you can purchase some parts to convert these transmissions to use your existing female CV shafts. Below are the part numbers, sourced from [this forum post](https://www.rs25.com/threads/the-six-speed-swap-thread.181311/).

- Axle Stub Shafts (x2): `38415AA110`
- Axle Circlips (x2): `805329010`
- Seals
  - Left: `806730041`
  - Right: `806730042`

  **NOTE:** All of this is in reference to an STI swap. Not sure if these part numbers are gonna work for the NA 2005 2.5 RS trans, but we're about to find out.

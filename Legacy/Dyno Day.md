# Dyno Day
[Here are the logs and tunes](./DynoDayLogsTunes.zip) from the [dyno day](https://youtu.be/rqVpZp-6DuU).

The tune is basically a bone stock Haltech EZ30R tune, that's been modified to run this car. 

I did not attempt to increase the ignition timing because this thing is already making good power on stock internals. I actually pulled two degrees up top.

We did do some steady state tuning, however, it was entirely unnecessary. No additional torque was to be had in the lower load cells, so I simply reverted the changes back to the base tune. Fueling was already spot on from road tuning/base tune.

The logs are pretty neat. The first log actually shows some knock being detected up top. I pulled two degrees, then that stopped. 

Never noticed knock on the street but the dyno holds us at that higher RPM a bit longer than we tend to stay while driving so that was neat.
